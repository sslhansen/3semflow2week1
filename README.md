Tuesday's tasks are in the project called jpademo.

The other tasks are in the project called RestPersons.
NOTE:
Task 3 with address is on the branch called task3

Status:
I should be done with all tasks assigned, but i have some testing thats missing, which was in the tasks optional.
I chose to complete some of the harder parts of the tasks instead of the testing.
There is some testing done in the task3 branch
